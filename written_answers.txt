Instance 1: RHEL IP: 18.193.99.63 this IP is Elastic IP which is binded to my account
Instance 2: Ubuntu IP: 3.71.17.206 this IP is Floating IP which means it is not static. It will be changed if instance will be restarted

SSH key was assigned during creation for both instance.
Also to be able to connect between two instances I made secure copy of private key into .ssh folders of each instance ($HOME/.ssh/)
To be able to ping both servers security settings were updated. (Add ICMP rule to inbound)

Nginx was installed to Ubuntu instance
